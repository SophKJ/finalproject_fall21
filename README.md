**Project title:** Influence of Temperature and Precipitatin on Forest Fires

---------------

**Hypothesis:** Forest fires are becoming more freqent and intense every season with climate change. This research aims to analyze the trend of forest fires and fuel emissions, with a closer look at the Okanogan Complex Fire in 2015. Trends in maximum temperature and precipitation will be analyzed, to examine their relationship to fire behavior, as well as the spatial distributions of forest fires, fuel emissions and their burning index. These results will support research on forest fire risk and climate change. <br>

**Analysis Plan:**
1. Plot Fire and Fuel Emissions over time
2. Plot maximum temperature over time
3. Plot precipitation trends over time
4. Correlate fire and fuel emissions with maximum temperature
5. Take a closer look at these trends during the Okanogan Complex Fire of 2015 as a case study
6. What trends emerge? <br>
